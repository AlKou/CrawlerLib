This is my first GitHub portfolio.
The first file is CrawlerLibDownload.py, which is created in Apr last year when I was starting to learn Python for data science. 
The crawler gets search results based on keyword input from a Japanese library, obtains the urls to related PDF files and downloads these fiels to a specified folder automatically.
After being downloaded, the second file FileMerger.py merges documents with the same title to a single PDF file.
